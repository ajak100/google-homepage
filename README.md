This is my first day of actually using Git and Github, even though I tried it before. I'm doing this for The Odin Project Web Development 101 course. I'm actually studying CS but I feel like I miss a lot of stuff. So I wanna do as much project as I can through this great course, as I feel that's the only way I can learn.
